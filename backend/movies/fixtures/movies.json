Since all her architects are either busy otherwise or too conservative in style, this ambivalent honor falls to Edifis. He is to build the palace and be covered in gold or, if not, his fate is to be eaten by crocodiles. Edifis calls upon an old friend to help him out: The fabulous Druid Getafix from Gaul, who brews a fantastic potion that gives supernatural strength. In order to help and protect the old Druid, Asterix and Obelix accompany him on his journey to Egypt. When Julius Caesar gets wind of the project succeeding, he has the building site attacked by his troops in order to win the bet and not lose face. But just like the local pirates, he hasn't counted on Asterix and Obelix.",

Odd coincidences segue through dream logic, patching together scenes from his past while hinting at his fate. Enigmatic signs lead him to an eccentric hypnotherapist to address his fleeting grip on reality, but it may be too late. This incredibly imaginative film explores ideas of memory, identity and time as powerful yet dangerously fragile constructs, often beyond our simple ken. Ingeniously playing with time and space, Imaginur poses bold questions about existence with stunning cinematic bravado.",
